    "# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed Fandango's aggregated movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. He published his analysis in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) â€” a great piece of data journalism worth reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system since Hickey's analysis."
